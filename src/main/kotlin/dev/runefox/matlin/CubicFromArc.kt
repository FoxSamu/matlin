/**
 * Returns a list of [Cubic] BÃ©zier curves that approximate a circular arc. The arc sweeps counterclockwise
 * between `fromAngle` and `toAngle` in a coordinate system where X is to the right and Y is upwards.
 *
 * The arc sweeps around the center point defined by `centerX` and `centerY`, and it's radius is, unsurprisingly,
 * determined by the `radius` parameter.
 * Typically, `radius` should not be negative, but the method will not check for it and it will simply approximate the
 * arc as if all points as if `PI` was added to both angles. When `radius` is zero, all the curves will be point curves.
 * It will still return the amount of curves that it would return if `radius` where not zero.
 *
 * The angle swept out is determined by `fromAngle` and `toAngle`. These angles are given in radians, but they can be
 * set to any value. Values outside the range `0 .. 2*PI` will simply be wrapped within this range, e.g. `3.5 * PI` will
 * be interpreted as `1.5 * PI`. An angle of `0` radians points towards positive X, and higher values sweep that angle
 * counterclockwise (if Y is upwards).
 * The arc is traced counterclockwise from `fromAngle` to `toAngle` (wrapped). If `toAngle` is less than `fromAngle`,
 * the arc will be traced beyond `2*PI` radians until it hits `toAngle + 2*PI`. When the angles are equal, a full circle
 * will be traced out, starting from `fromAngle`.
 *
 * The final list of curves will follow the arc counterclockwise, but this can be changed by setting the `reverse`
 * parameter. When `reverse` is set to `true`, the returned curves will follow the traced arc clockwise. This parameter
 * does **not** influence the arc that is swept out, only the direction of the curves, i.e. the arc will look the same
 * no matter this value.
 *
 * The `accuracy` parameter sets, as the name suggests, an accuracy level of the circular arc. The value of this
 * parameter determines how much an arc gets subdivided. These subdivisions are then approximated with curves.
 * More specifically, the `accuracy` parameter determines how much arcs to subdivide a full circle into. If the input
 * arc sweeps less than a full circle, it may have less subdivisions, but each subdivision will have at most an arc
 * length of `2 * PI / accuracy`.
 * Smaller arclengths are easier to approximate, so more subdivisions give more accurate results at the cost of speed
 * and memory usage. The time and memory complexity of this algorithm are linearly related to this parameter.
 * An accuracy of 4 already creates splines that are indistinguishable from a real circular arc. Accuracies less than 2
 * will be interpreted as 2, since approximating a circle with 1 curve is not possible.
 *
 * @param centerX   The X coordinate of the center of the arc.
 * @param centerY   The Y coordinate of the center of the arc.
 * @param radius    The radius of the arc.
 * @param fromAngle The starting angle of the arc, in radians. Default is `0.0`.
 * @param toAngle   The ending angle of the arc, in radians. Default is `0.0`.
 * @param accuracy  The accuracy of the arc approximation. Default is `4`.
 * @param reverse   Whether to reverse the direction of the curves or not. Default is `false`.
 * @param out       A list instance to modify. It will be cleared by the function. Default is a new list.
